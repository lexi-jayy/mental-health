                My Name is lexi-jayy critchley, 
                i have been struggling with mental illness for a longtime, I have had anxiety and depression for a long time, when I was a really young child my mum and dad would fight a lot they seperated, 
                for years after that my mum would have a string of relationships that always had arguing in them and it was very stressful hearing my mum argue a lot it was terrifying, 
                with that trauma I became rather "sensitive" as people would say.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes a person saying something would make me cry and I was made fun of for that for many years which caused me to be taken out of schools a lot. 
                So I didn't really have any friends growing up so I felt isolated and cautious of making friends because I would never know when I would be taken out of school to move to another town.
                When highschool came around I was terrified that people that bullied me in primary school were gonna be there and bully me in highschool as well, 
                which It didnt really happen with people from primary school mainly new people.
            </p>


            <p>  
                During my second year of high school my eldest brother died and was found in a culvert I guess you could say that is what drove my depression deeper than what it had been before, I still remember the night that my dad got a call from my mum saying that my eldest brother has died, 
                it was on a weekend when I chose to stay at my dad's so I guess I felt angry upset and confused at myself thinking why did i let this happen? Maybe if I went there this weekend my brother would still be alive and hadn't gone to that party, 
                I was speechless all I could do for the rest of the weekend was cry.
              </p>
              <p> 
                On the Monday I remember going to my mum's house in akatara upper hutt, when I first walked through the door I saw my mum and I just ran to the bathroom and bursted into tears, 
                it was like this wave of emotions washed over like the realization that my brothers death actually happened and that it wasnt all in my head.
            </p>
            <p>
                It sort of spiraled downward for a couple of years after his death i got into the basic stuff to try and help me cope with the situation (sex, drugs, alcohol, self harm) what a lot of people do when they get depressed and try to find something that will help them feel anything,
                i did try to commit suicide a couple of times when i was young but i never succeded which was good because i wouldnt be here today, it wasn't up until about two years ago(2017) that it started to change.
              </p>
            <p>
                I was very depressed and was having anxiety attacks everytime I would leave the house, so I got sent to the catt(Crisis assessment teams) team, through their help,
                I got onto my path of realizing that I am a women when I had that realization it gave me something to live for again something to help me become happy again, 
                with a lot of determination I was able to start hrt(hormone replacement therapy) and start a life for the women that I am to be a happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                As I am writing this it is Monday April 1st 2019 and I can say that I still struggle with depression and anxiety but it doesn't completely control me now but somedays it is really tough to deal with. 
                i have some things that help me throught those tough days like gaming, watching netflix with my boyfriend, chocolate, not being alone, my boyfriend helps me through the bad days and he is the best thing that I could have asked for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every year on May 25th(the anniversary of my brothers death) and August 25th(His birthday) i get pretty depressed but i have my partner to help me out which is great,
                That concludes my Story with Mental Health so far.
            </p>
            <p>
              To Anyone That Happens to be reading this, pain will pass with time it will take a while but it will go(i didnt use to believe these words either but now i do and they help everyday), i am proud of you for making it this far and hope you are able to overcome the troubles that are happining at the moment.
