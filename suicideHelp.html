                        If you’re having thoughts of suicide, you are not alone. Lots of us have thought about killing ourselves and have found a way through. 
                        If you experience suicidal thoughts, 13 Reasons Why may be very distressing or triggering for you. This is understandable and you deserve help.

                        Most people who attempt suicide don’t want to die – they just want their pain to end or can't see another way out of their situation. 
                        Support from people who care about them, and connection with their own sense of culture, identity and purpose, can help them to find a way through.

                      13 Reasons Why contain graphic and confronting scenes of rape and sexual assault. 
                      Most forms of sexual violence are shown, including rape, rape threats, sexual harassment, sexual bullying, 
                      sharing unwanted sexual images and coercion.

                  <p>
                      The characters who experience sexual violence do not consent or are unable to consent. 
                      As is the case with 90% of cases of sexual violence in New Zealand, 
                      the characters who are raped or sexually assaulted know their attackers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      These scenes may be traumatising to viewers who have been raped or sexually assaulted. 
                      Many viewers will know what it’s like to experience slut-shaming, abuse, harassment and even rape, and watching the show may bring up difficult memories or feelings.

                        Some of the romantic relationships in 13 Reasons Why (such as Bryce and Chloe’s relationship) are unhealthy. 
                        Unhealthy relationships can be very damaging and are sometimes dangerous. Often they involve a power imbalance and the use of threats, intimidation, violence and name-calling. 
                        People in unhealthy relationships often find it difficult to trust each other or resolve conflicts respectfully and constructively.

                        In 13 Reasons Why, bullying is shown to be relatively common and extremely harmful. 
                        New Zealand has the highest rate of bullying in schools in the developed world. Unfortunately, many people still think bullying is just a normal part of growing up, but that’s not true. 
                        It is never okay and can have long-term impacts on both the person doing the bullying and the person being bullied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Young people who are bullied are more likely to develop mental health issues that may lead to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. 
                        Young people who bully others are more likely to drop out of school or perform worse academically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re being bullied or have been bullied, watching 13 Reasons Why may have made you feel uncomfortable, 
                        sad or angry, or brought up upsetting memories or feelings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with other issues, 13 Reasons Why gives us the opportunity to talk to young people about their own experiences of bullying – does it take place at their school? 
                        Have they experienced it? Witnessed it? Could their own behaviour be seen as bullying?
